# SmartFridge

SmartFridge is an app designed to help users track what food they have in their house, as well as expiration dates to reduce the amount of food wasted.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository to your local system. Switch to the /smartfridge/app folder. From there, run
```
npm install
```
Once the install completes, start the app using the command
```
npm start
```
This command will give you a local url to access the dev controls for the app. It usually points to http://localhost:19002/. Open the URL in your browser.

Ensure your Android emulator is already running before proceeding to the next step.

In the web UI, click the `Run on Android device/emulator`. This will initiate the JavaScript build and open the app on your emulator.
